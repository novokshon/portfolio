# Optimization opportunities in retail company


## Project description

The purpose of the project is to analyze sales for the year and based on customer demand and understand how to help the company with optimization.

The client owns a store with unique gifts for all occasions from stationery stickers to silver jewelry. The company's clients are both customers (B2C) and business partners (B2B). Sales are made online all over the world.

## Process

I cleaned up the data in Excel and changed the datatypes to import the data into MsSQL. Using SQL queries, I extracted the information I needed. Then I used PowerBi to create an interactive dashboard to visualize and understand the data.

## Tools

- EXCEL
- MS SQL 
- Power BI

For this project, I used a modified dataset from Kaggle.com as input data.


## Conclusion

As a result, we helped the client navigate the sales results for the year and, based on customer demand, we suggested options to increase sales
- 70 percent of customers who buy  WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER also buy CINAMMIN SET OF 9 T-LIGHTS. Client can  increase the average check by having two products in stock that customers are most likely to buy together, or the client can offer a second product (or an alternative) in addition to the purchase of first product;
- The highest number of orders is in the pre-Christmas season in November and December. It would be good for the client to be prepared before that season and to have enough products in stock. Or schedule deliveries in such a way as to save on transportation services;
- We know which products are most in demand and the most interested for customers. On this basis, the client can expand his assortment and offer customers products of a similar type.
